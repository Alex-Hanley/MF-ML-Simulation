# MF-ML-Simulation
A very quick simulation of business data being added, appended, and then ran through a basic regression test for correlations between data points.

There are comments to show the steps. I first asked ChatGPT to provide me with a bunch of random data to import. To simulate
the appending of our potentially significant AI data, I asked ChatGPT to add 2 extra columns; the business structure. I then ran a machine learning algorithm to see if the appended business structurse were correlated to the revenue produces by each
company. Because this data was randomly generated, there was most certanly no correlation. 

I made this analysis very quickly, but it serves as a skeleton to what we could do with this newly appended data. This can
be scaled and made very easy for anyone to use!
